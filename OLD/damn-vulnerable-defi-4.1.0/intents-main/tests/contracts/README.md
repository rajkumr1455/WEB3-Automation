# Contracts
This directory contains contracts which are used as helpers in tests

## Multi-token receiver stub
Helper contract for testing transfer callbacks

## Target
Contains wasms of the contracts which are used in tests

- The `non_fungible_token.wasm` file was built from https://github.com/near-examples/NFT default, using `cargo near build non-reproducible-wasm`.

The rest were added before creating this readme file. In the future, such information will be added for further wasm files that would be added to this directory.
