# ML-Ops Engine

Continuous learning engine that improves detection accuracy through automated model training and rule generation.

## Features

- **Continuous Learning**: Automatically learns from validated findings
- **Pattern Extraction**: Extracts vulnerability patterns from code and traces
- **Model Training**: Trains ML models for each vulnerability type
- **Rule Generation**: Auto-generates detection rules with confidence scores
- **Metrics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics on accuracy and performance
- **Feedback Loop**: Integrates with validator-worker for continuous improvement

## Quick Start

See implementation plan for full details. Service runs on port 8011 and provides endpoints for ingesting findings, training models, and generating detection rules.
